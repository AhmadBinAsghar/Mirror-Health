    HealthMetrics: {
        BPM: "We calculate your BPM by using Mirror’s Prism PPG sensors to detect signals in your body. It measures the time between each heartbeat to determine your heart rate.",
        HRV: "HRV is calculated using Mirror’s Prism PPG sensors by analyzing the small differences in time between consecutive heartbeats. The sensors in the ring track these intervals to give an indication of your autonomic nervous system activity.",
        VA: "We calculate your vascular age by measuring pulse wave velocity (PWV) with Mirror’s Prism PPG sensors. PWV reflects artery stiffness, helping us estimate how your blood vessels compare to your biological age.",
        RHR: "RHR is calculated using Mirror’s Prism PPG sensors by measuring the number of times your heart beats per minute while at rest. The sensors in the ring continuously track your heart rate throughout the day and night, providing insights into your cardiovascular health and fitness levels."
    },
    RespiratoryMetrics: {
        SPO2: "Your SpO2 is measured using Mirror’s Prism PPG sensors that shine through your skin to detect how much oxygen is being carried in your blood. The reflected light helps us estimate your blood oxygen saturation."
    },
    SleepMetrics: {
        Sleep: "We analyze your sleep by tracking your heart rate, movement, and body temperature throughout the night. These signals help us understand your sleep stages, including deep, light, and REM sleep."
    },
    ImmuneMetrics: {
        Temp: "Your temperature is monitored through built-in sensors that measure the skin temperature throughout the data. This data helps track daily variations in your body’s temperature.",
        HRV: "HRV is calculated using Mirror’s Prism PPG sensors by analyzing the small differences in time between consecutive heartbeats. The sensors in the ring track these intervals to give an indication of your autonomic nervous system activity."

    StressMetrics: {
        Temp: "Your temperature is monitored through built-in sensors that measure the skin temperature throughout the data. This data helps track daily variations in your body’s temperature.",
        Stress: "We measure your stress by analyzing heart rate variability (HRV) using Mirror’s Prism PPG sensors, detecting changes in your body's stress response."

    ActMetrics: {
        Activities: "We monitor your movements with motion sensors to estimate your activity level and calories burned."
